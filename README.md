The theme I use for Wikipedia

It's based of 'modern', and in this repo is the CSS I override with.

To enable:

1. Log into Wikpedia
2. Go to [preferences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Preferences)
3. Click on the [appearance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Preferences#mw-prefsection-rendering) tab
4. Select *modern* from the skin section, then click on *custom css*
5. Click on *edit this page* and add you custom css... or my css from this repo :)
6. Hit save page and enjoy the new look of your Wikipedia!


When enabled, the front page looks like this:
